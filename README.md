# Starting template (voilerplate) for a front end Typescript + React project. 

Comes with:
 - **Typescript**
- **React**
- **Redux**
- **React-Router**
- **TSLint rules coded by me and a configuration that bans: "object", "any" and other practices that js devs use when they don't fully understand what is the idea of using a typed language**
- **TSLint errors are also displayed in the browser console as warnings to give them more visibility**
- **CSS Modules**
- **SASS**
- **Environment variables**
- **Webpack**
## Installation

1. Run: `npm install`. On Windows you must also run: `npm install -g win-node-env`. That is all.
2. **Optional** but highly recomended: Install TSLint extension for VSCode or for your prefered text editor. Also configure your editor to fix automatically tslint issues on save, to improve productivity.
3. **Optional**: This project is compatible with the chrome extension: "Redux DevTools", you can install it too.
